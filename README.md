Structure of plots, there are folders for different tests performed on either counties within a state or the whole state itself (California)

The folders contain different plots here is a short description for them

Shannon_values_per_county_plots: The shannon index plotted from 2006 to 2015 by month for every county in California

Shannon_5_fires_test_per_county_plots: 5 plots of a certain period of the shannon index plotted after the day of the largest amount of acres burned by wildfire from 2006 to 2015, and a 6th plot from a random date and the period after that plotted for all counties.

regression_per_county_plots: Plots of the linear regression between the shannon index and acres burnt by wilfdires normalized.

California_plots: Contains a mix of all of the above with some added self-explanatory plots contained in the same folder for the whole state


# To test the code run testing.py to run all implemented functionality. The tests are using a small sample of our very large original dataset
